#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "Aizere"
print(x)
print(y)

x = 5
y = "Aizere"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "dbhduyf" # x is now of type str
print(x)


x = "Aizere"
# is the same as
x = 'Aizere'

#This will create two variables:
a = 4
A = "vfky"
#A will not overwrite a


x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
